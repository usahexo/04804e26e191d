#  What are the 5 tips?

There are plenty of excellent pieces of writing advice out there, but if you’re looking for the five most essential tips to get started, here they are:

1. Start with an outline.

When you sit down to write a first draft, it can be tempting to just start typing away and see where the words take you. However, this can often lead to a disorganized and incomplete piece of writing. A better approach is to start by creating an outline – this will help you to stay on track and ensure that your piece has a clear structure.

2. Use strong verbs.

One of the best ways to make your writing more powerful and engaging is to use strong verbs instead of weak ones. For example, rather than saying “he walked”, say “he strutted” or “he sauntered”. This will make your writing more vivid and interesting to read.

3. Use specific details.

Another way to make your writing more engaging is to use specific details. Rather than simply stating what happened, try to describe how it happened using sensory details. This will help your readers to feel like they are right there experiencing the event themselves.

4. Use active voice wherever possible.

The active voice is more powerful and concise than the passive voice, so try to use it whenever possible in your writing. For example, rather than saying “The door was opened by John”, say “John opened the door”. This makes your writing sound more energetic and immediate.

5. Edit ruthlessly.

Once you’ve finished writing your piece, don’t just publish it as is! Take some time to edit it ruthlessly, cutting out any unnecessary words or phrases and making sure that it flows logically from beginning to end.
