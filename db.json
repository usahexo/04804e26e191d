essential tips to get started, here they are:\n\n1. Start with an outline.\n\nWhen you sit down to write a first draft, it can be tempting to just start typing away and see where the words take you. However, this can often lead to a disorganized and incomplete piece of writing. A better approach is to start by creating an outline – this will help you to stay on track and ensure that your piece has a clear structure.\n\n2. Use strong verbs.\n\nOne of the best ways to make your writing more powerful and engaging is to use strong verbs instead of weak ones. For example, rather than saying “he walked”, say “he strutted” or “he sauntered”. This will make your writing more vivid and interesting to read.\n\n3. Use specific details.\n\nAnother way to make your writing more engaging is to use specific details. Rather than simply stating what happened, try to describe how it happened using sensory details. This will help your readers to feel like they are right there experiencing the event themselves.\n\n4. Use active voice wherever possible.\n\nThe active voice is more powerful and concise than the passive voice, so try to use it whenever possible in your writing. For example, rather than saying “The door was opened by John”, say “John opened the door”. This makes your writing sound more energetic and immediate.\n\n5. Edit ruthlessly.\n\nOnce you’ve finished writing your piece, don’t just publish it as is! Take some time to edit it ruthlessly, cutting out any unnecessary words or phrases and making sure that it flows logically from beginning to end.\n\n#  What is the criterion to be followed for mastering image processing?\n\nImage processing is a field of digital image processing, manipulation and analysis. With the advancements in computer technology, this filed has grown significantly over the past few years. It is now used extensively in a number of industries for various purposes. Image processing can be used for enhancing or repairing images, extracting features from images for classification or identification purposes, etc.\n\nMastering image processing is not an easy task. There are a number of criterion that need to be followed for mastering this field. Some of these criterion are listed below:\n\n1) Understanding the basics of digital images: This is the most important step for mastering image processing. One needs to have a basic understanding of digital images and how they are stored and processed. This can be achieved by taking some courses in digital imaging or reading some books on the subject.\n\n2) Understanding the principles of image processing: Once you have understood the basics of digital images, it is important to learn about the fundamentals of image processing.
